# Docker (RC - Run Commands (Helpers))
# IMPORTANT - this needs to remain bash & zsh compatible

# NOTE - When running docker-compose, some services will copy data, volumes
# back to the environment, folder they are being run in. E.g. a database
# may write to /data and you need to be aware that deleting this folder or
# running the docker-compose in another folder or location will not return
# any data you may have saved.

# Run all docker-compose commands inside the vytools/docker/ directory for
# safety and persistence of experience. Never run docker-compose in your
# project or repo-protected folders.

# (cd'ing to the docker/ directory simplifies everything)
